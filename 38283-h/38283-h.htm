the Middle Ages, as well as of modern Europe. They will
appear in the same handy Shilling volumes, with neat cloth
bindings and paper envelopes, which have proved so attractive
in the case of the <i>Religions</i>. The writing in each case will be
confided to an eminent authority, and one who has already
proved himself capable of scholarly yet popular exposition
within a small compass.</p>

<h3>LIFE AND WRITINGS</h3>


<p>Arthur Schopenhauer may be distinctively
described as the greatest philosophic writer of
his century. So evident is this that he has
sometimes been regarded as having more importance
in literature than in philosophy; but this
is an error. As a metaphysician he is second to
no one since Kant. Others of his age have surpassed
him in system and in comprehensiveness;
but no one has had a firmer grasp of the essential
and fundamental problems of philosophy.
On the theory of knowledge, the nature of reality,
and the meaning of the beautiful and the good,
he has solutions to offer that are all results of a
characteristic and original way of thinking.</p>

<p>In one respect, as critics have noted, his spirit
is different from that of European philosophy in
general. What preoccupies him in a special way
is the question of evil in the world. Like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
philosophies of the East, emerging as they do
without break from religion, Schopenhauer's
philosophy is in its outcome a doctrine of redemption
from sin. The name of pessimism commonly
applied to it is in some respects misleading,
though it was his own term; but it is correct if
understood as he explained it. As he was accustomed
to insist, his final ethical doctrine coincides
with that of all the religions that aim, for their
adepts or their elect, at deliverance from 'this
evil world.' But, as the 'world-fleeing' religions
have their mitigations and accommodations, so
also has the philosophy of Schopenhauer. At
various points indeed it seems as if a mere
change of accent would turn it into optimism.</p>

<p>This preoccupation does not mean indifference
to the theoretical problems of philosophy. No
one has insisted more strongly that the end of
philosophy is pure truth, and that only the few
who care about pure truth have any concern with
it. But for Schopenhauer the desire for speculative
truth does not by itself suffice to explain
the impulse of philosophical inquiries. On one
side of his complex character, he had more
resemblance to the men who turn from the world
to religion, like St. Augustine, than to the normal
type of European thinker, represented pre-emi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>nently
by Aristotle. He was a temperamental
pessimist, feeling from the first the trouble of
existence; and here he finds the deepest motive
for the desire to become clear about it. He saw
in the world, what he felt in himself, a vain effort
after ever new objects of desire which give no
permanent satisfaction; and this view, becoming
predominant, determined, not indeed all the ideas
of his philosophy, but its general complexion as
a 'philosophy of redemption.'</p>

<p>With his pessimism, personal misfortunes had
nothing to do. He was, and always recognised
that he was, among the most fortunately placed
of mankind. He does not hesitate to speak
sometimes of his own happiness in complete
freedom from the need to apply himself to any
compulsory occupation. This freedom, as he has
put gratefully on record, he owed to his father,
Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer, who was a rich
merchant of Danzig, where the philosopher was
born on the 22nd of February 1788. Both his
parents were of Dutch ancestry. His mother,
Johanna Schopenhauer, won celebrity as a novelist;
and his sister, Adele, also displayed some
literary talent. Generalising from his own case,
Schopenhauer holds that men of intelligence
derive their character from their father and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
their intellect from their mother. With his
mother, however, he was not on sympathetic
terms, as may be read in the biographies. His
father intended him for a mercantile career, and
with this view began to prepare him from the
first to be a cosmopolitan man of the world. The
name of Arthur was given to him because it is
spelt alike in the leading European languages.
He was taken early to France, where he resided
from 1797 to 1799, learning French so well that
on his return he had almost forgotten his German.
Portions of the years 1803 to 1804 were spent
in England, France, Switzerland, and Austria. In
England he was three months at a Wimbledon
boarding-school kept by a clergyman. This experience
he found extremely irksome. He afterwards
became highly proficient in English: was
always pleased to be taken for an Englishman,
and regarded both the English character and
intelligence as on the whole the first in Europe;
but all the more deplorable did he find the oppressive
pietism which was the special form taken in
the England of that period by the reaction against
the French Revolution. He is never tired of
denouncing that phase of 'cold superstition,'
the dominance of which lasted during his lifetime;
for the publication of Mill's <i>Liberty</i> and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Darwin's <i>Origin of Species</i>, which may be considered
as marking the close of it, came only the
year before his death.</p>

<p>The only real break in the conformity of
Schopenhauer's circumstances to his future career
came in 1805, when he was placed in a merchant's
office at Hamburg, whither his father had
migrated in disgust at the annexation of his
native Danzig, then under a republican constitution
of its own, by Prussia in 1793. Soon
afterwards his father died; but out of loyalty he
tried for some time longer to reconcile himself
to commercial life. Finding this at length impossible,
he gained permission from his mother,
in 1807, to leave the office for the gymnasium.
At this time he seems to have begun his classical
studies, his education having hitherto been exclusively
modern. They were carried on first at
Gotha and then at Weimar. In 1809 he entered
the university of Göttingen as a student of
medicine. This, however, was with a view only
to scientific studies, not to practice; and he transferred
himself to the philosophical faculty in
1810. Generally he was little regardful of
academical authority. His father's deliberately
adopted plan of letting him mix early with the
world had given him a certain independence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
judgment. At Göttingen, however, he received
an important influence from his teacher, G. E.
Schulze (known by the revived scepticism of
his <i>Ænesidemus</i>), who advised him to study Plato
and Kant before Aristotle and Spinoza. From
1811 to 1813 he was at Berlin, where he heard
Fichte, but was not impressed. In 1813 the
degree of Doctor of Philosophy was conferred on
him at Jena for the dissertation <i>On the Fourfold
Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason</i>
(<i>Ueber die vierfache Wurzel des Satzes vom zureichenden
Grunde</i>, 2nd ed., 1847). This was the
first result of his Kantian studies. In the same
year he began to be acquainted with Goethe at
Weimar, where his mother and sister had gone
to reside in 1806. A consequence of this
acquaintance was that he took up and further
developed Goethe's theory of colours. His dissertation
<i>Ueber das Sehen und die Farben</i> was
published in 1816. A second edition did not
appear till 1854; but in the meantime he had
published a restatement of his doctrine in Latin,
entitled <i>Theoria Colorum Physiologica</i> (1830).
This, however, was an outlying part of his work.
He had already been seized by the impulse to
set forth the system of philosophy that took
shape in him, as he says, by some formative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
process of which he could give no conscious
account. His great work, <i>Die Welt als Wille
und Vorstellung</i>, was ready for publication
before the end of 1818, and was published with
the date 1819. Thus he is one of the most
precocious philosophers on record. For in that
single volume, written before he was thirty, the
outlines of his whole system are fixed. There
is some development later, and there are endless
new applications and essays towards confirmation
from all sources. His mind never rested,
and his literary power gained by exercise. Still,
it has been said with truth, that there never
was a greater illusion than when he thought that
he seldom repeated himself. In reality he did
little but repeat his fundamental positions with
infinite variations in expression.</p>

<p>After completing his chief work, Schopenhauer
wrote some verses in which he predicted
that posterity would erect a monument to him.
This prediction was fulfilled in 1895; but, for the
time, the work which he never doubted would
be his enduring title to fame seemed, like Hume's
<i>Treatise</i>, to have fallen 'deadborn from the press.'
This he attributed to the hostility of the academical
philosophers; and, in his later works, attacks
on the university professors form a characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
feature. The official teachers of the Hegelian
school, he declared, were bent only on obtaining
positions for themselves by an appearance of
supporting Christian dogma; and they resented
openness on the part of any one else.
Yet on one side he maintained that his own
pessimism was more truly Christian than their
optimism. The essential spirit of Christianity is
that of Brahmanism and Buddhism, the great
religions that sprang from India, the first home
of our race. He is even inclined to see in it
traces of Indian influence. What vitiates it in
his eyes is the Jewish element, which finds its
expression in the flat modern 'Protestant-rationalistic
optimism.' As optimistic religions, he
groups together Judaism, Islam, and Græco-Roman
Polytheism. His antipathy, however,
only extends to the two former. He was himself
in great part a child of Humanism and of the
eighteenth century, rejoicing over the approaching
downfall of all the faiths, and holding that
a weak religion (entirely different from those he
admires) is favourable to civilisation. Nothing
can exceed his scorn for nearly everything that
characterised the Middle Ages. With Catholicism
as a political system he has no sympathy
whatever; while on the religious side the Pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>testant
are as sympathetic to him as the Catholic
mystics. What is common to all priesthoods,
he holds, is to exploit the metaphysical need of
mankind (in which he also believes) for the sake
of their own power. Clericalism, 'Pfaffenthum,'
whether Catholic or Protestant, is the object of
his unvarying hatred and contempt. If he had
cared to appreciate Hegel, he would have found
on this point much community of spirit; but of
course there was a real antithesis between the
two as philosophers. No 'conspiracy' need be
invoked to explain the failure of Schopenhauer
to win early recognition. Belief in the State and
in progress was quite alien to him; and Germany
was then full of political hopes, which found
nourishment in optimistic pantheism. What at
length gave his philosophy vogue was the collapse
of this enthusiasm on the failure of the revolutionary
movement in 1848. Once known, it
contained enough of permanent value to secure
it from again passing out of sight with the next
change of fashion.</p>

<p>The rest of Schopenhauer's life in its external
relations may be briefly summed up. For a few
years, it was diversified by travels in Italy and
elsewhere, and by an unsuccessful attempt at
academical teaching in Berlin. In 1831 he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
moved to Frankfort, where he finally settled
in 1833. He lived unmarried there till his death
on the 21st of September 1860. The monument,
already spoken of, was unveiled at Frankfort on
the 6th of June 1895.</p>

<p>The almost unbroken silence with which his
great work was received, though it had a distempering
effect on the man, did not discourage
the thinker. The whole series of Schopenhauer's
works, indeed, was completed before he attained
anything that could be called fame. Constantly
on the alert as he was to seize upon confirmations
of his system, he published in 1836 his short
work <i>On the Will in Nature</i>, pointing out verifications
of his metaphysics by recent science. In
1839 his prize essay, <i>On the Freedom of the Human
Will</i> (finished in 1837), was crowned by the Royal
Scientific Society of Drontheim in Norway. This
and another essay, <i>On the Basis of Morality</i>, <i>not</i>
crowned by the Royal Danish Society of Copenhagen
in 1840, he published in 1841, with the
inclusive title, <i>Die beiden Grundprobleme der
Ethik</i>. In 1844 appeared the second edition of
his principal work, to which there was added,
in the form of a second volume, a series of
elucidations and extensions larger in bulk than
the first. This new volume contains much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
his best and most effective writing. His last
work, <i>Parerga und Paralipomena</i>, which appeared
in 1851 (2 vols.), is from the literary point
of view the most brilliant. It was only from this
time that he began to be well known among the
general public; though the philosophic 'apostolate'
of Julius Frauenstädt, who afterwards
edited his works, had begun in 1840. His activity
was henceforth confined to modifying and extending
his works for new editions; an employment
in which he was always assiduous. In
consequence of this, all of them, as they stand,
contain references from one to another; but the
development of his thinking, so far as there was
such a process after 1818, can be easily traced
without reference to the earlier editions. There
is some growth; but, as has been said, it does not
affect many of the chief points. A brief exposition
of his philosophy can on the whole take it as
something fixed. The heads under which it must
fall are those assigned to the original four books
of <i>Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung</i>.</p>

<p>Although Schopenhauer discountenanced the
attempt to connect a philosophers biography
with his work, something has to be said about
his character, since this has been dwelt on to his
disadvantage by opponents. There is abundant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
material for a personal estimate in the correspondence
and reminiscences published after his
death by his disciples Julius Frauenstädt and
Wilhelm Gwinner. The apparent contradiction
is at once obvious between the ascetic consummation
of his ethics and his unascetic life,
carefully occupied in its latter part with rules for
the preservation of his naturally robust health.
He was quite aware of this, but holds it absurd
to require that a moralist should commend only
the virtues which he possesses. It is as if the
requirement were set up that a sculptor is to be
himself a model of beauty. A saint need not be
a philosopher, nor a philosopher a saint. The
science of morals is as theoretical as any other
branch of philosophy. Fundamentally character
is unmodifiable, though knowledge, it is allowed,
may change the mode of action within the limits
of the particular character. The passage to the
state of asceticism cannot be effected by moral
philosophy, but depends on a kind of 'grace.'
After all, it might be replied, philosophers,
whether they succeed or not, do usually make
at least an attempt to live in accordance with
the moral ideal they set up. The best apology
in Schopenhauer's case is that the fault may
have been as much in his ideal as in his failure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
to conform to it. The eloquent pages he has
devoted to the subject of holiness only make
manifest the inconsequence (which he admits)
in the passage to it. For, as we shall see, this
has nothing in common with the essentially
rational asceticism of the schools of later antiquity;
which was a rule of self-limitation in view of the
philosophic life. He did in a way of his own
practise something of this; and, on occasion, he
sets forth the theory of it; but he quite clearly
sees the difference. His own ideal, which he
never attempted to practise, is that of the self-torturing
ascetics of the Christian Middle Age.
Within the range of properly human virtue, he
can in many respects hold his own, not only as
a philosopher but as a man. If his egoism and
vanity are undeniable, he undoubtedly possessed
the virtues of rectitude and compassion. What
he would have especially laid stress on was the
conscientious devotion to his work. With complete
singleness of purpose he used for a disinterested
end the leisure which he regarded as the most fortunate
of endowments. As he said near the close
of his life, his intellectual conscience was clear.</p>

<p>Of Schopenhauer's expositions of his pessimism
it would be true to say, as Spinoza says of the
Book of Job, that the matter, like the style, is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
that of a man sitting among the ashes, but of one
meditating in a library. This of course does not
prove that they are not a genuine, if one-sided,
rendering of human experience. All that can be
said is that they did not turn him away from
appreciation of the apparent goods of life. His
own practical principle was furnished by what he
regarded as a lower point of view; and this gives
its direction to the semi-popular philosophy of
the <i>Parerga</i>. From what he takes to be the
higher point of view, the belief that happiness is
attainable by man on earth is an illusion; but he
holds that, by keeping steadily in view a kind of
tempered happiness as the end, many mistakes
may be avoided in the conduct of life, provided
that each recognises at once the strength and
weakness of his own character, and does not
attempt things that, with the given limitations,
are impossible. Of the highest truth, as he conceived
it, he could therefore make no use. Only
by means of a truth that he was bound to hold
half-illusory could a working scheme be constructed
for himself and others. This result may give us
guidance in seeking to learn what we can from
a thinker who is in reality no representative of a
decadence, but is fundamentally sane and rational,
even in spite of himself.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE</h3>

<p>The title of Schopenhauer's chief work is rendered
in the English translation, <i>The World as
Will and Idea</i>. Here the term 'idea' is used in
the sense it had for Locke and Berkeley; namely,
any object of mental activity. Thus it includes
not merely imagery, but also perception. Since
Hume distinguished ideas' from 'impressions,'
it has tended to be specialised in the former
sense. The German word, <i>Vorstellung</i>, which it
is used to render, conveys the generalised meaning
of the Lockian 'idea,' now frequently expressed
in English and French philosophical works by the
more technical term 'presentation' or 'representation.'
By Schopenhauer himself the word
'Idea' was used exclusively in the sense of the
Platonic Idea, which, as we shall see, plays an
important part in his philosophy. The distinction
is preserved in the translation by the use of
a capital when Idea has the latter meaning; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
in a brief exposition it seems convenient to adopt
a more technical rendering of <i>Vorstellung</i>; and,
from its common employment in psychological
text-books, I have selected 'presentation' as the
most suitable.</p>

<p>The first proposition of Schopenhauer's philosophical
system is, 'The world is my presentation.'
By this he means that it presents itself as appearance
to the knowing subject. This appearance is
in the forms of time, space and causality. Under
these forms every phenomenon necessarily
appears, because they are <i>a priori</i> forms of the
subject. The world as it presents itself consists
entirely of phenomena, that is, appearances,
related according to these forms. The most fundamental
form of all is the relation between object
and subject, which is implied in all of them.
Without a subject there can be no presented
object.</p>

<p>Schopenhauer is therefore an idealist in the
sense in which we call Berkeley's theory of the
external world idealism; though the expressions
used are to some extent different. The difference
proceeds from his following of Kant. His Kantianism
consists in the recognition of <i>a priori</i>
forms by which the subject constructs for itself an
'objective' world of appearances. With Berkeley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
he agrees as against Kant in not admitting
any residue whatever, in the object as such, that
is not wholly appearance. But while he allows
that Berkeley, as regards the general formulation
of idealism, was more consistent than Kant, he
finds him, in working out the principle, altogether
inadequate. For the modern mind there is henceforth
no way in philosophy except through Kant,
from whom dates the revolution by which scholastic
dualism was finally overthrown. Kant's
systematic construction, however, he in effect
reduces to very little. His is a much simplified
'Apriorism.' While accepting the 'forms of sensible
intuition,' that is, time and space, just as
Kant sets them forth, he clears away nearly all
the superimposed mechanism. Kant's 'Transcendental
Æsthetic,' he says, was a real discovery in
metaphysics; but on the basis of this he for the
most part only gave free play to his architectonic
impulse. Of the twelve 'categories of the understanding,'
which he professed to derive from the
logical forms of judgment, all except causality are
mere 'blind windows.' This alone, therefore,
Schopenhauer adopts; placing it, however, not at
a higher level but side by side with time and
space, Kant's forms of intuition. These three
forms, according to Schopenhauer, make up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
understanding of men and animals. 'All intuition
is intellectual.' It is not first mere appearance
related in space and time, and waiting for understanding
to organise it; but, in animals as in
man, it is put in order at once under the three
forms that suffice to explain the knowledge all
have of the phenomenal world.</p>

<p>To Reason as distinguished from Understanding,
Schopenhauer assigns no such exalted function as
was attributed to it in portions of his system by
Kant, and still more by some of his successors.
The name of 'reason,' he maintains, ought on
etymological grounds to be restricted to the faculty
of abstract concepts. This, and not understanding,
is what distinguishes man from animals. It
discovers and invents nothing, but it puts in a
generalised and available form what the understanding
has discovered in intuition.</p>

<p>For the historical estimation of Schopenhauer,
it is necessary to place him in relation to Kant,
as he himself always insisted. Much also in his
chief work is made clearer by knowledge of his
dissertation <i>On the Fourfold Root of the Principle
of Sufficient Reason</i>, to which he is constantly
referring. Later, his manner of exposition became
more independent; so that he can be read by the
general reader with profit simply by himself, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
without reference to antecedents. Still, it will
always be advisable for an expositor to follow his
directions, at least to the extent of giving some
short account of the dissertation. This I proceed
to give approximately in the place to which he
has assigned it in his system.</p>

<p>The name of the principle (<i>principium rationis
sufficientis</i>) he took over from Leibniz and his
successor Wolff, but gave it a new amplitude.
With him, it stands as an inclusive term for four
modes of connection by which the thoroughgoing
relativity of phenomena to one another is constituted
for our intelligence. The general statement
adopted is, 'Nothing is without a reason
why it should be rather than not be.' Its four
forms are the principles of becoming (<i>fiendi</i>), of
knowing (<i>cognoscendi</i>), of being (<i>essendi</i>), and
of acting (<i>agendi</i>). (1) Under the first head
come 'causes.' These are divided into 'cause
proper,' for inorganic things; 'stimulus,' for the
vegetative life both of plants and animals, and
'motive,' for animals and men. The law of causation
is applicable only to changes; not to the
forces of nature, to matter, or to the world as a
whole, which are perdurable. Cause precedes
effect in time. Not one thing, but one state of a
thing, is the cause of another. From the law of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
causation there results an infinite series <i>a parte
ante</i> as well as <i>a parte post</i>. (2) The principle of
sufficient reason of knowing is applicable to concepts, which
are all derived from intuition, that
is, from percepts. The laws of logic, which come
under this head, can yield nothing original, but
can only render explicit what was in the understanding.
(3) Under the third head come arithmetical
and geometrical relations. These are
peculiar relations of presentations, distinct from
all others, and only intelligible in virtue of a pure
<i>a priori</i> intuition. For geometry this is space;
for arithmetic time, in which counting goes on.
Scientifically, arithmetic is fundamental. (4) As
the third form of causality was enumerated
'motive' for the will; but in that classification it
was viewed from without, as belonging to the
world of objects. Through the direct knowledge
we have of our own will, we know also from
within this determination by the presentation we
call a motive. Hence emerges the fourth form of
the principle of sufficient reason. This at a later
stage makes possible the transition from physics
to metaphysics.</p>

<p>All these forms alike are forms of necessary
determination. Necessity has no clear and true
sense but certainty of the consequence when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
ground is posited. All necessity therefore is conditional.
In accordance with the four expressions
of the principle of sufficient reason, it takes the
fourfold shape of physical, logical, mathematical,
and moral necessity.</p>

<p>The sharp distinction between logical and
mathematical truth, with the assignment of the
former to conceptual and of the latter to intuitive
relations, comes to Schopenhauer directly from
Kant. So also does his view that the necessary
form of causation is sequence; though here his
points of contact with English thinkers, earlier
and later, are very marked. Only in his statement
of the 'law of motivation' as 'causality seen
from within' does he hint at his own distinctive
metaphysical doctrine. Meanwhile, it is evident
that he is to be numbered with the group of
modern thinkers who have arrived in one way or
another at a complete scientific phenomenism.
Expositors have noted that in his earlier statements
of this he tends to lay more stress on the
character of the visible and tangible world as
mere appearance. The impermanence, the
relativity, of all that exists in time and space,
leads him to describe it, in a favourite term
borrowed from Indian philosophy, as Maya, or
illusion. Later, he dwells more on the relative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
reality of things as they appear. His position,
however, does not essentially alter, but only finds
varying expression as he turns more to the
scientific or to the metaphysical side. From
Hume's view on causation he differs not by
opposing its pure phenomenism, but only by
recognising, as Kant does, an <i>a priori</i> element in
the form of its law. German critics have seen in
his own formulation an anticipation of Mill, and
this is certainly striking as regards the general
conception of the causal order, although there is
no anticipation of Mill's inductive logic. On the
same side there is a close agreement with Malebranche
and the Occasionalists, pointed out by
Schopenhauer himself. The causal explanations
of science, he is at one with them in insisting,
give no ultimate account of anything. All its
causes are no more than 'occasional causes,'&mdash;merely
instances, as Mill expressed it afterwards,
of 'invariable and unconditional sequence.' From
Mill of course he differs in holding its form to be
necessary and <i>a priori</i>, not ultimately derived
from a summation of experiences; and, with the
Occasionalists, he goes on to metaphysics in its
sense of ontology, as Mill never did. The difference
here is that he does not clothe his metaphysics
in a theological dress.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>In the later development of his thought,
Schopenhauer dealt more expressly with the
question, how this kind of phenomenism is
reconcilable with a scientific cosmogony. On one
side the proposition, 'No object without subject,'
makes materialism for ever impossible; for the
materialist tries to explain from relations among
presentations what is the condition of all presentation.
On the other side, we are all compelled
to agree with the materialists that knowledge of
the object comes late in a long series of material
events. Inorganic things existed in time before
life; vegetative life before animal life; and only
with animal life does knowledge emerge.
Reasoned knowledge of the whole series comes
only at the end of it in the human mind. This
apparent contradiction he solves by leaving a
place for metaphysics. Our representation of the
world as it existed before the appearance of life
was indeed non-existent at the time to which we
assign it; but the real being of the world had
a manifestation not imaginable by us. For this,
we substitute a picture of a world such as we
should have been aware of had our 'subject,' with
its <i>a priori</i> forms of time, space, and causality,
been then present. What the reality is, is the
problem of the thing-in-itself (to use the Kantian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
term). This problem remains over; but we know
that the metaphysical reality cannot be matter;
for matter, with all its qualities, is phenomenal.
It exists only 'for understanding, through understanding,
in understanding.' These discriminations
made, Schopenhauer offers us a scientific
cosmogony beginning with the nebular hypothesis
and ending with an outline of organic evolution.
This last differs from the Darwinian theory in
supposing a production of species by definite steps
instead of by accumulation of small individual
variations. At a certain time, a form that has all
the characters of a new species appears among
the progeny of an existing species. Man is the
last and highest form to be evolved. From
Schopenhauer's metaphysics, as we shall see, it
follows that no higher form of life will ever
appear.</p>

<p>A word may be said here on a materialistic-sounding
phrase which is very prominent in
Schopenhauer's later expositions, and has been
remarked on as paradoxical for an idealist. The
world as presentation, he often says, is 'in the
brain.' This, it must be allowed, is not fully
defensible from his own point of view, except
with the aid of a later distinction. The brain as
we know it is of course only a part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
phenomenon of the subject,&mdash;a grouping of
possible perceptions. How then, since it is itself
only appearance, can it be the bearer of the whole
universe as appearance? The answer is that
Schopenhauer meant in reality 'the being of the
brain,' and not the brain as phenomenon. He
had a growing sense of the importance of
physiology for the investigation of mind; and
his predilection led him to adopt a not quite
satisfactory shorthand expression for the correspondence
we know scientifically to exist between
our mental processes and changes capable of
objective investigation in the matter of the
brain.</p>

<p>In science his distinctive bent was to the
borderland between psychology and physiology.
Hence came the attraction exercised on him by
Goethe's theory of colours. To his own theory,
though, unlike his philosophical system, it has
always failed to gain the attention he predicted
for it, the merit must be allowed of treating the
problem as essentially one of psychophysics.
What he does is to attempt to ascertain the
conditions in the sensibility of the retina that
account for our actual colour-sensations. This
problem was untouched by the Newtonian
theory; but Schopenhauer followed Goethe in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the error of trying to overthrow this on its own
ground. He had no aptitude for the special
inquiries of mathematics and physics, though he
had gained a clear insight into their general
nature as sciences. On the psycho-physical side
there is to-day no fully authorised theory. The
problem indeed has become ever more complex.
Schopenhauer's attempt, by combination of sensibilities
to 'light' and 'darkness,' to explain the
phenomena of complementary colours, deserves
at least a record in the long series of essays of
which the best known are the 'Young-Helmholtz
theory' and that of Hering. It marks an indubitable
advance on Goethe in the clear distinction
drawn between the mixture, in the ordinary
sense, that can only result in dilution to different
shades of grey, and the kinds of mixture from
which, in their view, true colours arise.</p>

<p>A characteristic position in Schopenhauer's
theory of knowledge, and one that is constantly
finding new expression in his writings, is the
distinction between abstract and intuitive knowledge already
touched on. Intuitive knowledge
of the kind that is common to men and animals,
as we have seen, makes up, in his terminology,
the 'understanding'; while 'reason' is the distinctively
human faculty of concepts. When he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
depreciates this, as he often does, in comparison
with 'intuition,' it must be remembered that he
does not limit this term to perception of particulars,
but ascribes to what he calls the
'Platonic Idea' a certain kind of union between
reason and 'phantasy,' which gives it an intuitive
character of its own. Thus intuition can stand,
though not in every case for what is higher, yet
always for that which is wider and greater and
more immediate. Whatever may be done with
reflective reason and its abstractions, every
effectual process of thought must end, alike for
knowledge and art and virtue, in some intuitive
presentation. The importance of reason for
practice is due to its generality. Its function is
subordinate. It does not furnish the ground of
virtuous action any more than æsthetic precepts
can enable any one to produce a work of art;
but it can help to preserve constancy to certain
maxims, as also in art a reasoned plan is necessary
because the inspiration of genius is not every
moment at command. Virtue and artistic genius
alike, however, depend ultimately on intuition:
and so also does every true discovery in science.
The nature of pedantry is to try to be guided
everywhere by concepts, and to trust nothing to
perception in the particular case. Philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
also Schopenhauer regards as depending ultimately
on a certain intuitive view; but he allows
that it has to translate this into abstractions.
Its problem is to express the <i>what</i> of the world
in abstract form: science dealing only with the
<i>why</i> of phenomena related within the world.
This character of philosophy as a system of
abstract concepts deprives it of the immediate
attractiveness of art; so that, as he says in one
place, it is more fortunate to be a poet than a
philosopher.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>METAPHYSICS OF THE WILL</h3>


<p>We have seen that scientific explanation does
not go beyond presentations ordered in space and
time. This is just as true of the sciences of
causation&mdash;the 'ætiological' sciences&mdash;as it is of
mathematical science. All that we learn from
Mechanics, Physics, Chemistry and Physiology,
is 'how, in accordance with an infallible rule,
one determinate state of matter necessarily
follows another: how a determinate change
necessarily conditions and brings on another
determinate change.' This knowledge does not
satisfy us. We wish to learn the significance of
phenomena; but we find that from outside, while
we view them as presentations, their inner meaning
is for ever inaccessible.</p>

<p>The starting-point for the metaphysical knowledge
we seek is given us in our own body. The
animal body is 'the immediate object of the
subject': in it as presentation the 'effects' of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
'causes' in the order of presentations external
to it are first recognised. Now in virtue of his
body the investigator is not pure knowing
subject standing apart from that which he knows.
In the case of the particular system of presentations
constituting his organism, he knows what
these presentations signify, and that is his <i>will</i>
in a certain modification. The subject appears
as individual through its identity with the
body, and this body is given to it in two different
ways: on one side as object among objects, and
subjected to their laws; on the other side as the
will immediately known to each. The act of
will and the movement of the body are not two
different states related as cause and effect; for
the relation of cause and effect belongs only to
the object, the phenomenon, the presentation.
They are one and the same act given in different
manners: the will, immediately to the subject;
the movement, in sensible intuition for understanding.
The action of the body is the objectified
act of will. Called at first the immediate
object of presentation, the body may
now, from the other side, be called 'the objectivity
of the will.'</p>

<p>Thus, as was said, the 'law of motivation'
discloses the inner nature of causality. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
causality in general we know only relations of
phenomena; but in the case of our own body we
know something else that those relations express;
namely, the act of will determined by motives.
Now there are in the world as presentation other
systems like that which we call our body. Unless
all these are to be supposed mere phantoms without
inner reality, we must infer by analogy, in
correspondence with like phenomena, other individual
wills similar to that which we know in ourselves.
This inference from analogy, universally
admitted in the case of human and animal bodies,
must be extended to the whole corporeal world.
The failure to take this step is where the purely
intellectual forms of idealism have come short.
Kant's 'thing-in-itself,' which is not subject to
the forms by which presentations become experience,
but which experience and its forms indicate
as the reality, has been wrongly condemned by
his successors as alien to idealism. It is true
that Kant did in some respects fail to maintain
the idealistic position with the clearness of
Berkeley; but his shortcoming was not in affirming
a thing-in-itself beyond phenomena. Here,
in Schopenhauer's view, is the metaphysical
problem that he left a place for but did not solve.
The word of the riddle has now been pronounced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Beyond presentation, that is, in itself and according
to its innermost essence, the world is that
which we find in ourselves immediately as will.
By this it is not meant that a falling stone, for
example, acts from a motive; knowledge and the
consequent action from motives belongs only to
the determinate form that the will has in animals
and men; but the reality in the stone also is the
same in essence as that to which we apply the
name of will in ourselves. He who possesses this
key to the knowledge of nature's innermost
being will interpret the forces of vegetation, of
crystallisation, of magnetism, of chemical affinity,
even of weight itself, as different only in phenomenal
manifestation but in essence the same;
namely, that which is better known to each than
all else, and where it emerges most clearly is
called will. Only the will is thing-in-itself. It is
wholly different from presentation, and is that of
which presentation is the phenomenon, the visibility,
the objectivity. Differences affect only the
degree of the appearing, not the essence of that
which appears.</p>

<p>While the reality everywhere present is not
will as specifically known in man, the mode
of indicating its essence by reference to this,
Schopenhauer contends, is a gain in insight. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
thing-in-itself ought to receive its name from
that among all its manifestations which is the
clearest, the most perfect, the most immediately
illumined by knowledge; and this is man's will.
When we say that every force in nature is to be
thought of as Will, we are subsuming an unknown
under a known. For the conception of Force is
abstracted from the realm of cause and effect,
and indicates the limit of scientific explanation.
Having arrived at the forces of nature on the one
side and the forms of the subject on the other,
science can go no further. The conception of
Will can make known that which was so far concealed,
because it proceeds from the most intimate
consciousness that each has of himself, where the
knower and the known coincide.</p>

<p>By this consciousness, in which subject and
object are not yet set apart, we reach something
universal. In itself the Will is not individualised,
but exists whole and undivided in every single
thing in nature, as the Subject of contemplation
exists whole and undivided in each cognitive
being. It is entirely free from all forms of the
phenomenon. What makes plurality possible is
subjection to the forms of time and space, by
which only the phenomenon is affected. Time
and space may therefore be called, in scholastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
terminology, the 'principle of individuation.'
While each of its phenomena is subject to the
law of sufficient reason, which is the law of
appearance in these forms, there is for the Will as
thing-in-itself no rational ground: it is 'grundlos.'
It is free from all plurality, although its phenomena
in space and time are innumerable. It is
one, not with the unity of an object or of a concept,
but as that which lies outside of space and
time, beyond the <i>principium individuationis</i>,
that is, the possibility of plurality. The individual,
the person, is not will as thing-in-itself,
but phenomenon of the will, and as such determined.
The will is 'free' because there is
nothing beyond itself to determine it. Further,
it is in itself mere activity without end, a blind
striving. Knowledge appears only as the accompaniment
of its ascending stages.</p>

<p>Here we have arrived at the thought which, in
its various expressions, constitutes Schopenhauer's
metaphysics. That this cannot be scientifically
deduced he admits; but he regards it as
furnishing such explanation as is possible of
science itself. For science there is in everything
an inexplicable element to which it runs back,
and which is real, not merely phenomenal. From
this reality we are most remote in pure mathe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>matics
and in the pure <i>a priori</i> science of nature
as it was formulated by Kant. These owe their
transparent clearness precisely to their absence of
real content, or to the slightness of this. The
attempt to reduce organic life to chemistry, this
again to mechanism, and at last everything to
arithmetic, could it succeed, would leave mere
form behind, from which all the content of phenomena
would have vanished. And the form would
in the end be form of the subject. But the enterprise
is vain. 'For in everything in nature there
is something of which no ground can ever be
given, of which no explanation is possible, no
cause further is to be sought.' What for man is
his inexplicable character, presupposed in every
explanation of his deeds from motives, that for
every inorganic body is its inexplicable quality,
the manner of its acting.</p>

<p>The basis of this too is will, and 'groundless,'
inexplicable will; but evidently the conception
here is not identical with that of the Will that is
one and all. How do we pass from the universal
to that which has a particular character or
quality? For of the Will as thing-in-itself we are
told that there is not a greater portion in a man
and a less in a stone. The relation of part and
whole belongs exclusively to space. The more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and less touches only the phenomenon, that is,
the visibility, the objectivation. A higher degree
of this is in the plant than in the stone, in the
animal than in the plant, and so forth; but the
Will that is the essence of all is untouched by
degree, as it is beyond plurality, space and time,
and the relation of cause and effect.</p>

<p>The answer to the question here raised is given
in Schopenhauer's interpretation of the Platonic
Ideas. These he regards as stages of objectivation
of the Will. They are, as Plato called them,
eternal forms related to particular things as
models. The lowest stage of objectivation of the
Will is represented by the forces of inorganic
nature. Some of these, such as weight and impenetrability,
appear in all matter. Some are
divided among its different kinds, as rigidity,
fluidity, elasticity, electricity, magnetism, chemical
properties. They are not subject to the
relation of cause and effect, but are presupposed
by it. A force is neither cause of an effect nor
effect of a cause. Philosophically, it is immediate
objectivity of the will; in ætiology, <i>qualitas
occulta</i>. At the lowest stages of objectivation,
there is no individuality. This does not appear
in inorganic things, nor even in merely organic
or vegetative life, but only as we ascend the scale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
of animals. Even in the higher animals the
specific enormously predominates over the individual
character. Only in man is the Idea
objectified in the individual character as such.
'The character of each individual man, so far as
it is thoroughly individual and not entirely comprehended
in that of the species, may be regarded
as a particular Idea, corresponding to a peculiar
act of objectivation of the Will.'</p>

<p>Schopenhauer warns us against substituting
this philosophical explanation for scientific ætiology.
The chain of causes and effects, he points
out, is not broken by the differences of the
original, irreducible forces. The ætiology and
the philosophy of nature go side by side, regarding
the same object from different points of view.
Yet he also gives us in relation to his philosophy
much that is not unsuggestive scientifically.
His doctrine is not properly evolutionary, since
the Ideas are eternal; but he has guarded incidentally
against our supposing that all the
natural kinds that manifest the Ideas phenomenally
must be always represented in every world.
For our particular world, comprising the sun and
planets of the solar system, he sets forth in the
<i>Parerga</i> an account of the process by which it
develops from the nebula to man. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
referred to in the preceding chapter. In his
fundamental work he describes a struggle,
present through the whole of nature, in which
the phenomenal manifestations of the higher
Ideas conquer and subjugate those of the lower,
though they leave them still existent and ever
striving to get loose. Here has been seen an
adumbration of natural selection: he himself
admits the difficulty he has in making it clear.
We must remember that it is pre-Darwinian.</p>

<p>Knowledge or intelligence he seeks to explain
as an aid to the individual organism in its
struggle to subsist and to propagate its kind. It
first appears in animal life. It is represented by
the brain or a large ganglion, as every endeavour
of the Will in its self-objectivation is represented
by some organ; that is, displays itself for presentation
as such and such an appearance.
Superinduced along with this contrivance for
aid in the struggle, the world as presentation,
with all its forms, subject and object, time, space,
plurality and causality, is all at once there.
'Hitherto only will, it is now at the same time
presentation, object of the knowing subject.'
Then in man, as a higher power beyond merely
intuitive intelligence, appears reason as the power
of abstract conception. For the most part,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
rational as well as intuitive knowledge, evolved
originally as a mere means to higher objectivation
of the Will, remains wholly in its service.
How, in exceptional cases, intellect emancipates
itself, will be discussed under the heads of
Æsthetics and Ethics.</p>

<p>That this view implies a teleology Schopenhauer
expressly recognises. Indeed he is a very
decided teleologist on lines of his own, and, in
physiology, takes sides strongly with 'vitalism'
as against pure mechanicism. True, the Will is
'endless' blind striving, and is essentially divided
against itself. Everywhere in nature there is
strife, and this takes the most horrible forms.
Yet somehow there is in each individual manifestation
of will a principle by which first the
organism with its vital processes, and then the
portion of it called the brain, in which is represented
the intellect with its <i>a priori</i> forms, are
evolved as aids in the strife. And, adapting all
the manifestations to one another, there is a
teleology of the universe. The whole world, with
all its phenomena, is the objectivity of the one
and indivisible Will; the Idea which is related
to all other Ideas as the harmony to the single
voices. The unity of the Will shows itself in the
unison of all its phenomena as related to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
another. Man, its clearest and completest objectivation,
is the summit of a pyramid, and could
not exist without this. Inorganic and organic
nature, then, were adapted to the future appearance
of man, as man is adapted to the development
that preceded him. But in thinking the
reality, time is to be abstracted from. The
earlier, we are obliged to say, is fitted to the
later, as the later is fitted to the earlier; but the
relation of means to end, under which we cannot
help figuring the adaptation, is only appearance
for our manner of knowledge. And the harmony
described does not get rid of the conflict inherent
in all will.</p>

<p>In this account of Schopenhauer's metaphysical
doctrine, I have tried to make the exposition as
smooth as possible; but at two points the discontinuity
can scarcely be concealed. First, the
relation of the universal Will to the individual
will is not made clear; and, secondly, the emergence
of the world of presentation, with the
knowledge in which it culminates, is left unintelligible
because the will is conceived as mere
blind striving without an aim. As regards the
first point, disciples and expositors have been able
to show that, by means of distinctions in his later
writings, apparent contradictions are to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
extent cleared away; and, moreover, that he
came to recognise more reality in the individual
will. On the second point, I think it will be
necessary to admit that his system as such breaks
down. But both points must be considered in
their connection.</p>

<p>One of the most noteworthy features of
Schopenhauer's philosophy is, as he himself
thought, the acceptance from first to last of Kant's
distinction between the 'empirical' and the 'intelligible'
character of the individual. Every act
of will of every human being follows with necessity
as phenomenon from its phenomenal causes;
so that all the events of each person's life are
determined in accordance with scientific law.
Nevertheless, the character empirically manifested
in the phenomenal world, while it is completely
necessitated, is the expression of something that
is free from necessitation. This 'intelligible
character' is out of time, and, itself undetermined,
manifests itself through that which develops in
time as a chain of necessary causes and effects.
That this doctrine had been taken up, without
any ambiguity as regards the determinism, by
Schelling as well as by himself, he expressly
acknowledges; and he finds it, as he also finds
modern idealism, anticipated in various passages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
by the Neo-Platonists. His adaptation of it to
his doctrine of the Ideas is distinctly Neo-Platonic
in so far as he recognises 'Ideas of individuals';
but of course to make Will the essence belongs to
his own system. 'The intelligible character,' he
says, 'coincides with the Idea, or, yet more precisely,
with the original act of will that manifests
itself in it: in so far, not only is the empirical
character of each man, but also of each animal
species, nay, of each plant species, and even of
each original force of inorganic nature, to be regarded
as phenomenon of an intelligible character,
that is, of an indivisible act of will out of time.'
This is what he called the '<i>aseitas</i>' of the will;
borrowing a scholastic term to indicate its derivation
(if we may speak of it as derived) from
itself (<i>a se</i>), and not from a supposed creative act.
Only if we adopt this view are we entitled to
regard actions as worthy of moral approval or
disapproval. They are such not because they are
not necessitated, but because they necessarily
show forth the nature of an essence the freedom
of which consists in being what it is. Yet he
could not but find a difficulty in reconciling this
with his position that the one universal Will is
identical in all things, and in each is 'individuated'
only by space and time. For the Ideas, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
thing-in-itself, are eternal, that is, outside of time
as well as space; and all the things now enumerated,
forces of nature, plant and animal species,
and individual characters of men, are declared to
be in themselves Ideas.</p>

<p>He in part meets this difficulty by the subtlety
that time and space do not, strictly speaking,
determine individuality, but arise along with it.
The diremption of individualities becomes explicit
in those forms. Yet he must have perceived that
this is not a complete answer, and various modifications
can be seen going on. His first view
clearly was that the individual is wholly impermanent,
and at death simply disappears; nothing
is left but the one Will and the universal Subject
of contemplation identical in all. Metempsychosis
is the best mythological rendering of what happens,
but it is no more. Later, he puts forward the not
very clearly defined theory of a 'palingenesia' by
which a particular will, but not the intellect that
formerly accompanied it, may reappear in the
phenomenal world. And the hospitality he
showed to stories of magic, clairvoyance, and
ghost-seeing, is scarcely compatible with the view
that the individual will is no more than a
phenomenal differentiation of the universal will.
A speculation (not put forward as anything more)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
on the appearance of a special providence in the
destiny of the individual, points, as Professor
Volkelt has noted, to the idea of a guidance, not
from without, but by a kind of good daemon or
genius that is the ultimate reality of the person.
On all this we must not lay too much stress; but
there is certainly one passage that can only be
described as a definite concession that the individual
is real in a sense not at first allowed.
Individuality, it is said in so many words
(<i>Parerga</i>, ii. § 117), does not rest only on the
'principle of individuation' (time and space), and
is therefore not through and through phenomenon,
but is rooted in the thing-in-itself. 'How deep
its roots go belongs to the questions which I do
not undertake to answer.'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>This tends to modify considerably, but does not
overthrow, Schopenhauer's original system. In
very general terms, he is in the number of the
'pantheistic' thinkers; and it is remarkable, on
examination, how these, in Europe at least, have
nearly always recognised in the end some permanent
reality in the individual. This is contrary
to first impressions: but the great names
may be cited of Plotinus, John Scotus Erigena,
Giordano Bruno, Spinoza (in Part v. of the <i>Ethics</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
and finally of Schopenhauer's special aversion,
Hegel, who has been supposed most unfavourable
of all to any recognition of individuality as real.
It is more true, Hegel maintains, that the individuality
determines its world than that it is
determined by it; and there is no explanation
why the determination should be such and such
except that the individuality was already what it
is.<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And, if Schopenhauer's more imaginative
speculations seek countenance from the side of
empiricism, there is nothing in them quite so
audacious as a speculation of J. S. Mill on disembodied
mind, thrown out during the time when
he was writing his <i>Logic</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The association with pantheism Schopenhauer
accepts in principle, though the name is not congenial
to him. In his system the Will is one and
all, like the 'Deus' of Spinoza. The difference is
that, instead of ascribing perfection to the universe
that is its manifestation, he regards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
production of a world as a lapse from which
redemption is to be sought. His doctrine has
been rightly described, in common with the predominant
philosophical doctrines of his period,
as a resultant of the deepened subjective analysis
brought by Kant into modern philosophy on the
one side, and of the return to Spinoza in the
quest for unity of principle on the other. Why,
then, it may be asked, are Fichte, Schelling, and
Hegel the constant objects of his attack? The
true explanation is not the merely external one,
that they were his successful rivals for public
favour, but is to be found in a real antithesis of
thought. Within the limits of the idealism they
all hold in common, Schopenhauer is at the
opposite pole. In spite of his attempt to incorporate
the Platonic Ideas, and in spite of his
following of Kant, whose 'intelligible world' was
in essence Platonic or neo-Platonic, he could find
no place in his system for a rational order at the
summit. Now this order was precisely what
Fichte and Hegel aimed at demonstrating. If
Schopenhauer is less unsympathetic in his
references to Schelling, that is because Schelling's
world-soul appeared to him to prefigure his own
attempt to discover in nature the manifestation
of a blindly striving will or feeling rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
reason. Suspicious as he shows himself of
possible plagiarisms by others, the charge cannot
be retorted against himself. The supreme principle
of Fichte, it has been pointed out, has an
actively volitional character and was formulated
before Schopenhauer's: but then it is essentially
rational. For Hegel, what is supreme is the
world-reason. Hence they are at one with Plato
in holding that in some sense 'mind is king.'
For Schopenhauer, on the contrary, mind, or
pure intellect, is an emancipated slave. Having
reached its highest point, and seen through the
work of the will, it does not turn back and
organise it, but abolishes it as far as its insight
extends.</p>

<p>Yet to say merely this is to give a wrong impression
of Schopenhauer. Starting though he
does with blind will, and ending with the flight
of the ascetic from the suffering inherent in the
world that is the manifestation of such a will, he
nevertheless, in the intermediate stages, makes
the world a cosmos and not a chaos. And the
Platonists on their side have to admit that 'the
world of all of us' does not present itself on the
surface as a manifestation of pure reason, and
that it is a serious task to 'rationalise' it. Where
he completely fails is where the Platonic systems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
also fail, though from the opposite starting-point.
His attempt to derive presentation, intellect,
knowledge, from blind striving, is undoubtedly
a failure. But so also is the attempt of the
Platonising thinkers to deduce a world of mixture
from a principle of pure reason without aid from
anything else empirically assumed. Not that in
either case there is failure to give explanations
in detail; but in both cases much is taken from
experience without reduction to the principles of
the system. What we may say by way of comparison
is this: that if Schopenhauer had in so
many words recognised an immanent Reason as
well as Will in the reality of the universe, he
would have formally renounced his pessimism;
while it cannot be said that on the other side a
more explicit empiricism in the account of the
self-manifestation of Reason would necessarily
destroy the optimism.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>ÆSTHETICS</h3>


<p>A portion of Schopenhauer's system by which
its pessimism is considerably mitigated is his
theory of the Beautiful and of Fine Art. The
characteristic of æsthetic contemplation is, he
finds, that intellect throws off the yoke and
subsists purely for itself as clear mirror of the
world, free from all subjection to practical purposes
of the will. In this state of freedom,
temporary painlessness is attained.</p>

<p>The theory starts from his adaptation of the
Platonic Ideas. Regarded purely as an æsthetic
theory, it departs from Plato, as he notes; for,
with the later Platonists, who took up the defence
of poetic myths and of the imitative arts as
against their master, he holds that Art penetrates
to the general Idea through the particular, and
hence that the work of art is no mere 'copy of a
copy.' The difference of the Idea from the
Concept is that it is not merely abstract and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
general, but combines with generality the characters
of an intuition.</p>

<p>The Ideas, as we have seen, constitute the
determinate stages of objectivation of the Will.
The innumerable individuals of which the Ideas
are the patterns are subject to the law of sufficient
reason. They appear, that is to say, under the
forms of time, space, and causality. The Idea is
beyond these forms, and therefore is clear of
plurality and change. Since the law of sufficient
reason is the common form under which stands
all the subject's knowledge so far as the subject
knows as individual, the Ideas lie outside the
sphere of knowledge of the individual as such.
If, therefore, the Ideas are to be the object of
knowledge, this can only be by annulling individuality
in the knowing subject.</p>

<p>As thing-in-itself, the Will is exempt even
from the first of the forms of knowledge, the form
of being 'object for a subject.' The Platonic
Idea, on the other hand, is necessarily an object,
something known, a presentation. It has laid
aside, or rather has not taken on, the subordinate
forms; but it has retained the first and most
general form. It is the immediate and most
adequate possible objectivity of the Will; whereas
particular things are an objectivation troubled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the forms of which the law of sufficient reason is
the common expression.</p>

<p>When intellect breaks loose from the service of
the will, for which it was originally destined in
the teleology of nature, then the subject ceases
to be merely individual and becomes pure will-less
subject of knowledge. In this state the beholder
no longer tracks out relations in accordance with
the principle of sufficient reason&mdash;which is the
mode of scientific as well as of common knowledge&mdash;but
rests in fixed contemplation of the given
object apart from its connection with anything
else. The contemplator thus 'lost' in the object,
it is not the single thing as such that is known,
but the Idea, the eternal form, the immediate
objectivity of the Will at this stage. The correlate
of this object&mdash;the pure Subject exempt from the
principle of sufficient reason&mdash;is eternal, like the
Idea.</p>

<p>The objectivation of the Will appears faintly in
inorganic things,&mdash;clouds, water, crystals,&mdash;more
fully in the plant, yet more fully in the animal,
most completely in man. Only the essential in
these stages of objectivation constitutes the Idea.
Its development into manifold phenomena under
the forms of the principle of sufficient reason, is
unessential, lies merely in the mode of knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
for the individual, and has reality only for this.
It is not otherwise with the unfolding of that
Idea which is the completest objectivation of the
Will. To the Idea of Man, the occurrences of
human history are as unessential as the shapes
they assume to the clouds, as the figures of its
whirlpools and foam-drift to the stream, as its
frost-flowers to the ice. The same underlying
passions and dispositions everlastingly recur in
the same modes. It is idle to suppose that anything
is gained. But also nothing is lost: so the
Earth-spirit might reply to one who complained
of high endeavours frustrated, faculties wasted,
promises of world-enlightenment brought to
nought; for there is infinite time to dispose of,
and all possibilities are for ever renewed.</p>

<p>The kind of knowledge for which the Ideas are
the object of contemplation finds its expression
in Art, the work of genius. Art repeats in its
various media the Ideas grasped by pure contemplation.
Its only end is the communication of
these. While Science, following the stream of
events according to their determinate relations,
never reaches an ultimate end, Art is always at
the end. 'It stops the wheel of time; relations
vanish for it: only the essence, the Idea, is its
object.' The characteristic of genius is a pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>dominant
capacity for thus contemplating things
independently of the principle of sufficient reason.
Since this requires a forgetting of one's own
person and the relations between it and things,
the attitude of genius is simply the completest
'objectivity.' The 'subjectivity' opposed to this,
in Schopenhauer's phraseology, is preoccupation
with the interests of one's own will. It is, he
says, as if there fell to the share of genius a
measure of intelligence far beyond the needs of
the individual will: and this makes possible the
setting aside of individual interests, the stripping
off of the particular personality, so that the subject
becomes 'pure knowing subject,' 'clear world-eye,'
in a manner sufficiently sustained for that which
has been grasped to be repeated in the work of
art. A necessary element in genius is therefore
Imagination. For without imagination to represent,
in a shape not merely abstract, things that
have not come within personal experience, genius
would remain limited to immediate intuition, and
could not make its vision apprehensible by others.
Nor without imagination could the particular
things that express the Idea be cleared of the
imperfections by which their limited expression
of it falls short of what nature was aiming at
in their production. 'Inspiration' is ascribed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
genius because its characteristic attitude is intermittent.
The man of genius cannot always remain
on a height, but has to fall back to the
level of the common man, who can scarcely at all
regard things except as they affect his interests,&mdash;have
a relation to his will, direct or indirect.</p>

<p>This is the statement in its first outline of a
theory that became one of Schopenhauer's most
fruitful topics. Many are the pages he has devoted
to the contrast between the man of genius
and 'the wholesale ware of nature, which she
turns out daily by thousands.' The genius is for
him primarily the artist. Scientific genius as a
distinctive thing he does not fully recognise; and
he regards men of action, and especially statesmen,
rather as men of highly competent ability
endowed with an exceptionally good physical
constitution than as men of genius in the proper
sense. Philosophers like himself, who, as he
frankly says, appear about once in a hundred
years, he classes in the end with the artists;
though this was left somewhat indeterminate in
his first exposition. The weakness of the man of
genius in dealing with the ordinary circumstances
of life he allows, and even insists on. Genius,
grasping the Idea in its perfection, fails to understand
individuals. A poet may know man pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>foundly,
and men very ill. He admits the
proximity of genius to madness on one side, and
explains it in this way. What marks the stage
of actual madness, as distinguished from illusion
or hallucination, is complete disruption of the
memory of past life, of the history of the personality
as something continuous; so that the particular
thing is viewed by itself, out of relation. This
gives a kind of resemblance to the attitude of
genius, for which present intuition excludes from
view the relations of things to each other. Or, as
we may perhaps sum up his thought in its most
general form, 'alienation' or dissolution of personality
has the resemblance often noted between
extremes to the impersonality, or, as he calls it,
'objectivity,' that is super-personal.</p>

<p>In spite of his contempt for the crowd, he has
to admit, of course, that the capacity of genius
to recognise the Ideas of things and to become
momentarily impersonal must in some measure
belong to all men; otherwise, they could not even
enjoy a work of art when produced. Genius has
the advantage only in the much higher degree
and the greater prolongation of the insight.
Since, then, the actual achievement of the artist
is to make us look into the world through his
eyes, the feelings for the beautiful and the sublime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
may be treated irrespectively of the question
whether they are aroused by nature and human
life directly or by means of art.</p>

<p>Æsthetic pleasure in contemplation of the
beautiful proceeds partly from recognition of the
individual object not as one particular thing but
as Platonic Idea, that is, as the enduring form of
this whole kind of things; partly from the consciousness
the knower has of himself not as
individual, but as pure, will-less Subject of Knowledge.
All volition springs out of need, therefore
out of want, therefore out of suffering. No attained
object of will can give permanent satisfaction.
Thus, there can be no durable happiness
or rest for us as long as we are subjects of will.
'The Subject of Will lies continually on the turning
wheel of Ixion, draws ever in the sieve of
the Danaides, is the eternally thirsting Tantalus.
But in the moment of pure objective contemplation,
free from all interest of the particular
subjectivity, we enter a painless state: the wheel
of Ixion stands still. The Flemish painters
produce this æsthetic effect by the sense of
disinterested contemplation conveyed in their
treatment of insignificant objects. There are
certain natural scenes that have power in themselves,
apart from artistic treatment, to put us in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
this state; but the slightest obtrusion of individual
interest destroys the magic. Past and distant
objects, through their apparent detachment, have
the same power. The essential thing æsthetically,
whether we contemplate the present or the past,
the near or the distant, is that only the world
of presentation remains; the world as will has
vanished.</p>

<p>The difference between the feelings of the
Beautiful and of the Sublime is this. In the feeling
of the beautiful, pure intelligence gains the
victory without a struggle, leaving in consciousness
only the pure subject of knowledge, so that
no reminiscence of the will remains. In the feeling
of the sublime, on the other hand, the state
of pure intelligence has to be won by a conscious
breaking loose from relations in the object that
suggest something threatening to the will; though
there must not be actual danger; for in that case
the individual will itself would come into play,
and æsthetic detachment would cease. Elevation
above the sense of terror has not only to be consciously
won but consciously maintained, and
involves a continuous reminiscence, not indeed of
any individual will, but of the will of man in
general, so far as it is expressed through its objectivity,
the human body, confronted by forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
hostile to it. Pre-eminently this feeling arises
from contrast between the immensities of space
and time and the apparent insignificance of man.
It means in the last resort that the beholder is
upheld by the consciousness that as pure subject
of knowledge (not as individual subject) he himself
bears within him all the worlds and all the
ages, and is eternal as the forces that vainly seem
to threaten him with annihilation.</p>

<p>On the objective side, and apart from the subjective
distinction just set forth, the sublime and
the beautiful are not essentially different. In
both cases alike, the object of æsthetic contemplation
is not the single thing, but the Idea that
is striving towards manifestation in it. Whatever
is viewed æsthetically is viewed out of relation to
time and space: 'along with the law of sufficient
reason the single thing and the knowing individual
are taken away, and nothing remains over
but the Idea and the pure Subject of Knowledge,
which together make up the adequate objectivity
of the Will at this stage.' There is thus a sense
in which everything is beautiful; since the Will
appears in everything at some stage of objectivity,
and this means that it is the expression of some
Idea. But one thing can be more beautiful than
another by facilitating æsthetic contemplation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
This facilitation proceeds either from the greater
clearness and perfection with which the particular
thing shows forth the Idea of its kind, or from the
higher stage of objectivation to which that Idea
corresponds. Man being the highest stage of
objectivation of the Will, the revelation of his
essence is the highest aim of art. In æsthetic
contemplation of inorganic nature and vegetative
life, whether in the reality or through the medium
of art, and in appreciation of architecture, the subjective
aspect, that is to say, the enjoyment of pure
will-less knowledge, is predominant; the Ideas
themselves being here lower stages of objectivity.
On the other hand, when animals and men are
the object of æsthetic contemplation or representation,
the enjoyment consists more in the objective
apprehension of those Ideas in which the essence
of the Will is most clearly and fully manifested.</p>

<p>Of all Schopenhauer's work, its æsthetic part
has met with the most general appreciation.
Here especially he abounds in observations drawn
directly, in his own phrase, from intuition. To
make a selection of these, however, is not appropriate
to a brief sketch like the present. I pass
on, therefore, to those portions of his theory of
Art by which he makes the transition, in terms of
his system, to Morality.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>From Architecture onward the arts are obliged
to represent the Will as divided. Here, at the
first stage, its division subsists only in a conflict
of inorganic forces which have to be brought to
equilibrium. The conflict between weight and
rigidity is in truth the only æsthetic material of
architecture as a fine art. When we come to
animal and lastly to human life, which, in the
Plastic Arts and in Poetry, as form, individualised
expression, and action, is the highest object of
æsthetic representation, the vehemence of divided
will is fully revealed; and here too is revealed
the essential identity of every will with our own.
In the words of the Indian wisdom, 'Tat twam
asi'; 'that thou art.' Under the head of Ethics
it will be shown expressly that by this insight,
when it reacts on the will, the will can deny itself.
For the temporary release from its striving, given
in æsthetic contemplation, is then substituted
permanent release. To this 'resignation,' the
innermost essence of all virtue and holiness, and
the final redemption from the world, Art itself, at
its highest stages, points the way.</p>

<p>The summits of pictorial and poetic art Schopenhauer
finds in the great Italian painters so far as
they represent the ethical spirit of Christianity,
and in the tragic poets, ancient and modern. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
is true that the poverty of their sacred history or
mythology puts the Christian artists at a disadvantage;
but events are merely the accidents of
their art. Not in these, as related according to
the law of sufficient reason, is the essence, but in
the spirit we divine through the forms portrayed.
In their representation of men full of that spirit,
and especially in the eyes, we see mirrored the
knowledge that has seized the whole essence of
the world and of life, and that has reacted on
the will, not so as to give it motives, but as a
'quietive'; whence proceeds complete resignation,
and with it the annulling of the will and of the
whole essence of this world. Of tragedy, the
subject-matter is the conflict of the will with
itself at its highest stage of objectivity. Here
also the end is the resignation brought on by
complete knowledge of the essence of the world.
The hero, on whom at last this knowledge has
acted as a quietive, gives up, not merely life, but
the whole will to live. 'The true meaning of
tragedy is the deeper insight, that what the hero
expiates is not his particular sins, but original sin,
that is, the guilt of existence itself.' To illustrate
this position Schopenhauer is fond of quoting a
passage from Calderon which declares that the
greatest sin of man is to have been born.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems strange that, after deriding as he does
the popular notion of 'poetic justice' so detached
a thinker should imagine an at least equally one-sided
view to receive its final confirmation from
the Spanish dramatist's poetic phrasing of a
Christian dogma. The great tragic poets, for
Schopenhauer also, are Æschylus, Sophocles and
Shakespeare. Now it is safe to say that by none
of these was any such general doctrine held either
in conceptual or in intuitive form. The whole
effect of any kind of art, of course he would
admit, cannot be packed into a formula; but if
we seek one as an aid to understanding, some
adaptation of his own theory of the sublime would
probably serve much better as applied to tragedy
than his direct theory of the drama. In the case
of pictorial art, all that is proved by what he says
about the representation of ascetic saintliness, is
that this, like many other things, can be so
brought within the scope of art as to make us
momentarily identify ourselves with its Idea in
the impersonal manner he has himself described.
His purely æsthetic theory is quite adequate to
the case, without any assumption that this is the
representation of what is best. Art, pictorial or
poetic, can no more prove pessimism than optimism.
We pick out expressions of one or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
other for quotation according to our moods or
subjective preferences; but, if we have the feeling
for art itself, our sense of actual æsthetic value
ought to be independent of these.</p>

<p>Schopenhauer's æsthetic theory, however, does
not end here. There follows the part of it by
which he has had an influence on artists themselves.
For him, a position separate from all the
other arts is held by music. While the rest
objectify the Will mediately, that is to say, by
means of the Ideas, Music is as immediate an
objectivation of the whole Will as the world itself,
or as the Ideas, of which the pluralised phenomenon
constitutes the sum of particular things.
The other arts speak of the shadow, music of the
substance. There is indeed a parallelism, an analogy,
between Music and the Ideas; yet Music
never expresses the phenomenon in which these are
manifested, but only the inner essence behind the
appearance, the Will itself. In a sense it renders
not feeling in its particularity, but feeling <i>in
abstracto</i>; joy, sorrow, not a joy, a sorrow. The
phenomenal world and music are to be regarded
as two different expressions of the same thing.
The world might be called embodied Music as
well as embodied Will. 'Melodies are to a certain
extent like general concepts, an abstract of reality.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
A complete explanation of music, that is, a detailed
repetition of it in concepts, were this
possible, would be a complete explanation of the
world (since both express the same thing) and
therefore a true and final philosophy. As music
only reaches its perfection in the full harmony,
'so the one Will out of time finds its perfect objectivation
only in complete union of all the stages
which in innumerable degrees of heightened distinctness
reveal its essence.' But here, too,
Schopenhauer adds, the Will is felt, and can
be proved, to be a divided will; and the deliverance
wrought by this supreme art, as by all the others,
is only temporary.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<h3>ETHICS</h3>


<p>Permanent redemption from the suffering of the
world is to be found only in the holiness of the
ascetic; but to this there are many stages, constituting
the generally accepted human virtues.
Of these Schopenhauer has a rational account
to give in terms of his philosophy; and if the
last stage does not seem to follow by logical
sequence from the others, this is only what is to
be expected; for it is reached, in his view, by a
sort of miracle. To the highest kind of intuitive
knowledge, from which the ascetic denial of the
will proceeds, artistic contemplation ought to
prepare the way; and so also, on his principles,
ought the practice of justice and goodness. Yet
he is obliged to admit that few thus reach the
goal. Of those that do reach it, the most arrive
through personal suffering, which may be deserved.
A true miracle is often worked in the repentant
criminal, by which final deliverance is achieved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Though the 'intelligible character' is unalterable,
and the empirical character can only be the unfolding
of this, as every great dramatist intuitively
recognises, yet the 'convertites,' like Duke
Frederick in <i>As You Like It</i>, are not to be regarded
as hypocrites. The 'second voyage' to the harbour,
that of the disappointed egoist, on condition
of this miracle, brings the passenger to it as
surely as the first, that of the true saints, which is
only for the few. And in these equally a miraculous
conversion of the will has to be finally
worked.</p>

<p>At the entrance to his distinctive theory of
ethics, Schopenhauer places a restatement of his
metaphysics as the possible basis of a mode of
contemplating life which, he admits, has some
community with an optimistic pantheism. The
Will, through the presentation and the accompanying
intelligence developed in its service,
becomes conscious that that which it wills is precisely
the world, life as it is. To call it 'the will
to live' is therefore a pleonasm. 'Will' and 'will
to live' are equivalent. For this will, life is everlastingly
a certainty. 'Neither the will, the thing-in-itself
in all phenomena, nor the subject of
knowledge, the spectator of all phenomena, is ever
touched by birth and death.' It is true that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
individual appears and disappears; but individuality
is illusory. Past and future exist only in
conceptual thought. 'The form of life is a present
without end, howsoever the individuals, phenomena
of the Idea, come into existence and vanish
in time, like fugitive dreams.' Only as phenomenon
is each man different from the other
things of the world: as thing-in-itself he is the
Will, which appears in all, and death takes away
the illusion that divides his consciousness from
the rest. 'Death is a sleep in which the individuality
is forgotten: everything else wakes again,
or rather has remained awake.' It is, in the expression
adopted by Schopenhauer later, an
awakening from the dream of life: though this
bears with it somewhat different implications;
and, as has been said, his theory of individuality
became modified.</p>

<p>With the doctrine of the eternal life of the
Will are connected Schopenhauer's theories, developed
later, of the immortality of the species
and of individualised sexual love. The latter is
by itself a remarkable achievement, and constitutes
the one distinctly new development
brought to completion in his later years; for the
modifications in his theory of individuality are
only tentative. His theory of love has a deter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>minate
conclusion, of great value for science, and
not really compatible, it seems to me, with his
pessimism. In its relation to ethics, on which he
insisted, it is rightly placed in the position it
occupies, between the generalised statement of
his metaphysics just now set forth on the one
side, and his theory of human virtue on the
other.</p>

<p>The teleology that manifests itself in individualised
love is, in his view, not related in reality to
the interests of the individual life, but to those of
the species. That this is immortal follows from
the eternity of the Idea it unfolds.<a name="FNanchor_1_4" id="FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The end
sought is aimed at unconsciously by the person.
Fundamentally, for Schopenhauer, teleology must
of course be unconscious, since the will is blind,
and will, not intelligence, is primordial. Its
typical case is the instinct of animals; but the
'instinctive' character belongs also to the accomplishment
of the highest aims, as in art and
virtue. What characterises individualised love
internally is the aim, attributed to 'nature' or
'the species,' at a certain typical beauty or per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>fection
of the offspring. The lover is therefore
deluded in thinking that he is seeking his own
happiness. What looks through the eyes of
lovers is the genius of the race, meditating on the
composition of the next generation. It may, in the
complexity of circumstances, be thwarted. When
it reaches its end, often personal happiness is
sacrificed. Marriages dictated by interest tend
to be happier than love-matches. Yet, though
the sacrifice of the individual to the race is involuntary
in these, egoism is after all overcome;
hence they are quite rightly the object of a
certain admiration and sympathy, while the
prudential ones are looked upon with a tinge of
contempt. For here too that element appears
which alone gives nobility to the life either of
intellect or of art or of moral virtue, namely, the
rising above a subjective interest of the individual
will.</p>

<p>No doubt there are touches of pessimism in
this statement; but the general theory does not
seem reconcilable finally with pessimism as
Schopenhauer understands it. For it is a definitely
stated position of his that nature keeps up the
process of the world by yielding just enough to
prevent discontinuance of the striving for an
illusory end. Yet he admits here in the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
something beyond bare continuance of life; for
this is already secured without the particular
modification of feeling described. What the feeling
is brought in to secure is a better realisation
of the type in actual individuals; and such realisation
is certainly more than bare subsistence
with the least possible expenditure of nature's
resources.</p>

<p>As the immediate preliminary to his ethics
proper, Schopenhauer restates his doctrine on the
intelligible and the empirical character in man,
and lays down a generalised psychological position
regarding the suffering inherent in life.
Everything as phenomenon, we have seen already,
is determined because it is subject to the law of
sufficient reason. On the other hand, everything
as thing-in-itself is free; for 'freedom' means
only non-subjection to that law. The intelligible
character of each man is an indivisible, unalterable
act of will out of time; the developed and
explicit phenomenon of this in time and space is
the empirical character. Man is his own work,
not in the light of knowledge, but before all
knowledge; this is secondary and an instrument.
Ultimately, freedom is a mystery, and takes us
beyond even will as the name for the thing-in-itself.
In reality, that which is 'will to live' need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
not have been such (though we cannot see how
this is so), but has become such from itself and
from nothing else. This is its '<i>aseitas</i>.' Hence
it is in its power to deny itself as will to live.
When it does this, the redemption (like the fall)
comes from itself. This denial does not mean
annihilation, except relatively to all that we know
under the forms of our understanding. For the
will, though the nearest we can get to the thing-in-itself,
is in truth a partially phenomenalised
expression of this. As the will to live expresses
itself phenomenally, so also does the denial of the
will to live, when this, by special 'grace,' is
achieved. Only in man does the freedom thus
attained find phenomenal expression. That man
can attain to it proves that in him the will has
reached its highest possible stage of objectivation;
for, after it has turned back and denied itself,
there is evidently nothing more that we can call
existence, that is to say, phenomenal existence,
beyond. What there is beyond in the truth of
being is something that the mystics know&mdash;or
rather, possess, for it is beyond knowledge&mdash;but
cannot communicate.</p>

<p>The psychological reason that can be assigned
for the ascetic flight from the world is that all
pleasure, happiness, satisfaction, is merely nega<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>tive.
The will is a striving that has no ultimate
aim. It is sustained only by hindrances. Hindrance
means suffering; and every satisfaction
attained is only temporary, a mere liberation from
need, want, pain, which is positive. Suffering
increases with the degree of consciousness. The
life of civilised man is an alternation between
pain and <i>ennui</i>, which can itself become as intolerable
a suffering as anything. The problem
of moral philosophy, then, is ultimately how
redemption from such a world is to be attained,
but only so far as this is a matter of conceptual
knowledge. For philosophy, being from beginning
to end theoretical, cannot work the practical
miracle by which the will denies itself.</p>

<p>The intuitive, as distinguished from merely
conceptual, knowledge by which the return is
made, consists essentially in a clear insight into
the identity of the suffering will in all things and
the necessity of its suffering as long as it is will
to live. This, then, is the true foundation of
morality. The universe as metaphysical thing-in-itself,
as noumenon, has an ethical meaning. All
its stages of objectivation, though in the process
what seems to be aimed at is preservation of the
will as manifested, have in truth for their ultimate
aim its redemption by suppression of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the phenomenal world in which it manifests
itself.</p>

<p>Affirmation of the will is affirmation of the
body, which is the objectivity of the will. The
sexual impulse, since it affirms life beyond the
death of the individual, is the strongest of self-affirmations.
In it is found the meaning of the
mythical representation that has taken shape in
the theological dogma of original sin. For by this
affirmation going beyond the individual body,
suffering and death, as the necessary accompaniment
of the phenomenon of life, are reaffirmed,
and the possibility of redemption this time
declared fruitless. But through the whole process
there runs eternal justice. The justification of
suffering is that the will affirms itself; and the
self-affirmation is justified by payment of the
penalty.</p>

<p>Before the final redemption&mdash;which is not for
the world but for the individual&mdash;there are many
stages of ethical progress. These consist in the
gradual overcoming of egoism by sympathy. And
here Schopenhauer proceeds to set forth a practical
scheme for the social life of man, differing from
ordinary utilitarianism only by reducing all sympathy
to pity, in accordance with his view that
there can be no such thing as positive happiness.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>He begins with a theory of justice, legal and
moral, very much on the lines of Hobbes, except
that he regards it as up to a certain point <i>a
priori</i>. Here he is consistent throughout. As
in his philosophical account of mathematics and
physics, so also in his aesthetics and ethics, he
retained, side by side with a strong empirical
tendency, belief in certain irreducible <i>a priori</i>
forms without which our knowledge cannot be
constituted. The pure ethical theory of justice,
he says, bears to the political theory the relation
of pure to applied mathematics. Injustice he
holds to be the positive conception. It means
the breaking into the sphere of another person's
will to live. The self-affirmation of the will that
appears in one individual body is extended to
denial of the will that appears in other bodies.
Justice consists in non-encroachment. There is
a 'natural right,' or 'moral right,' of resistance to
injustice by infliction of what, apart from the attempted
encroachment, would be wrong. Either
force or deception may be used; as either may be
the instrument of injustice. The purely ethical
doctrine of justice applies only to action; since
only the not doing of injustice depends on us.
With the State and its laws, the relation is reversed.
The object of these is to prevent the suffering of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
injustice. The State is not directed against egoism,
but has sprung out of a rationalised collective
egoism. It has for its purpose only to avoid the
inconvenient consequences of individual aggressions
on others. Outside of the State, there is a
right of self-defence against injustice, but no right
of punishment. The punishment threatened by
the State is essentially a motive against committing
wrong, intended to supply the place of ethical
motives for those who are insufficiently accessible
to them. Actual infliction of it is the carrying
out of the threat when it has failed, so that in
general the expectation of the penalty may be
certain. Revenge, which has a view to the past,
cannot be justified ethically: punishment is
directed only to the future. There is no right
in any one to set himself up as a moral judge
and inflict pain; but man has a right to do what
is needful for social security. The criminal's acts
are of course necessitated; but he cannot justly
complain of being punished for them, since it is
ultimately from himself, from what he is, that
they sprang.</p>

<p>With the doctrine of 'eternal justice,' touched
on above, we pass into a different region of
thought. What is responsible for the guilt in
the world is the Will by which everything exists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
and the suffering everlastingly falls where the
guilt is. Take the case of apparently unpunished
injustice (from the human point of view) expressing
itself in the extreme form of deliberate cruelty.
Through this also, eternal justice, from which
there is no escape, is fulfilled. 'The torturer and
the tortured are one. The former errs in thinking
he has no share in the torture; the latter in
thinking he has no share in the guilt.' For all
the pain of the world is the expiation of the sin
involved in the self-affirmation of will, and the
Will as thing-in-itself is one and the same in all.</p>

<p>If this could satisfy any one, there would be no
need to go further. The whole being as it ought
to be, why try to rectify details that are absolutely
indifferent? But of course the implication is that
individuality is simply illusory; and this, as has
been said, was a position that Schopenhauer
neither could nor did consistently maintain.
Indeed, immediately after setting forth this theory
of 'eternal justice,' he goes on to a relative justification
of those acts of disinterested vengeance
by which a person knowingly sacrifices his own
life for the sake of retribution on some extraordinary
criminal. This, he says, is a form of
punishment, not mere revenge, although it involves
an error concerning the nature of eternal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
justice. Suicide involves a similar error, in so
far as it supposes that the real being of the individual
can be assailed through its phenomenal
manifestation. It is not a denial of the will to
live, but a strong affirmation of it, only not in the
given circumstances: different circumstances are
desired with such intensity that the present cannot
be borne. Therefore the individual manifestation
of the will is not suppressed. Yet, one might
reply, if individuality is an illusion attached to
the appearance in time and space of a particular
organism, it would seem that, with the disappearance
of this, all that distinguishes the
individual must disappear also.</p>

<p>Schopenhauer had no will thus to escape from
life; nor did he afterwards devote himself to
expounding further his theory of eternal justice.
What he wrote later, either positively or as mere
speculation, implies both greater reality in the
individual and more of cosmic equity to correspond.
His next step, even at his first stage, is
to continue the exposition of a practicable ethics
for human life. His procedure consists in adding
beneficence to justice, with the proviso already
mentioned, which is required by his psychology,
that all beneficence can consist only in the relief
of pain. For Schopenhauer, as for Comte, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
is to be overcome is 'egoism,' an excessive degree
of which is the mark of the character we call
'bad.' The 'good' is what Comte and Spencer
call the 'altruistic' character. This difference
between characters Schopenhauer goes on to
explain in terms of his metaphysics. The egoist
is so deluded by the principle of individuation
that he supposes an absolute cleft between his
own person and all others. The remorse of
conscience from which he suffers proceeds in
part from an obscure perception that the principle
of individuation is illusory. Genuine virtue
springs out of the intuitive (not merely abstract)
knowledge that recognises in another individuality
the same essence as in one's own. The
characteristic of the good man is that he makes
less difference than is customary between himself
and others. Justice is an intermediate stage
between the encroaching egoism of the bad and
positive goodness. In the renunciation of rights
of property, and provision for all personal needs
without aid from others, practised by some
religious and philosophical ascetics, it is passing
over into something more. There is, however,
a certain misunderstanding involved in so interpreting
strict justice; for there are many ways
in which the rich and powerful can be positively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
beneficent. At the other extreme, when they
simply live on their inherited wealth, without
doing anything in return, their mode of life is
morally, though not legally, unjust. Rights of
property Schopenhauer derived from labour
spent on the things appropriated. The injustice,
in many ways, of the present social order he quite
recognises. If he has no sympathy with revolutions,
it is because he has no belief in the
realisation of an ideal state. This follows from
his view of history. Human life, it is his conviction,
never has been and never will be different
as a whole. Redemption from evil can be
attained only by the individual. All that the
State can do is to provide certain very general
conditions of security under which there will be
no hindrance to those who desire to live in
accordance with a moral ideal.</p>

<p>Yet there are qualifications to make. Many
passages in Schopenhauer's writings prove his
firm belief in the future triumph of reason over
superstition. It is to the honour of humanity,
he says, that so detestable a form of evil
as organised religious persecution has appeared
only in one section of history. And, in his
own personal case, he has the most complete
confidence that the truths he has put forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
cannot fail sometime to gain a hearing. In all
cases, error is only temporary, and truth will
prevail. His language on this subject, and indeed
often on others, is indistinguishable from
that of an optimist.</p>

<p>In the last resort, his pessimism entrenches
itself behind the psychological proposition that
every satisfaction is negative, being only the
removal of a pain. If this is unsustainable, there
is nothing finally in his Metaphysics of Will to
necessitate the pessimistic conclusion drawn.
The mode of deduction by which he proceeds is
to argue first to the position already noticed:
that all that love of others on which morality is
based is fundamentally pity. True benevolence
can only be the desire to relieve others' pain,
springing from the identification of this with
our own. For that reason, moral virtue must
finally pass over into asceticism&mdash;the denial of
the will to live. In others, if we are able to see
through the principle of individuation, we recognise
the same essence as in ourselves, and we
perceive that as long as this wills it must
necessarily suffer. The end then is to destroy the
will to live. This is to be done by <i>askesis</i>, self-mortification.
The first step is complete chastity.
If, says Schopenhauer, the highest phenomenon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of will, that is, man, were to disappear through
a general refusal to affirm life beyond the
individual body, man's weaker reflexion in the
animal world would disappear also, and the
consciousness of the whole would cease. Knowledge
being taken away, the rest would vanish
into nothingness, since there is 'no object without
subject.' That this will come to pass, however,
he certainly did not believe. He has no cosmogony,
like that of Hartmann, ending in a general
redemption of the universe by such a collective
act. Nor did he hold, like his later successor
Mainländer, that through the conflict and gradual
extinction of individualities, 'this great world
shall so wear out to nought.' The world for
him is without beginning and without end. But
the exceptional individual can redeem himself.
What he does when he has reached the height of
holiness is by voluntary poverty and all other
privations, inflicted for their own sake, to break
and kill the will, which he recognises as the
source of his own and of the world's suffering
existence. In his case not merely the phenomenon
ends at death, as with others, but the
being is taken away. To be a 'world-overcomer'
in this sense (as opposed to a 'world-conqueror')
is the essence of sanctity when cleared of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
superstitious dogmas by which the saints try to
explain their mode of life to themselves.</p>

<p>The absolutely pure expression of this truth is
to be found only in philosophy; but of the
religions Buddhism comes nearest to expressing
it without admixture. For the Buddhist saint
asks aid from no god. True Christianity, however,&mdash;the
Christianity of the New Testament
and of the Christian mystics,&mdash;agrees both with
Buddhism and with Brahmanism in ultimate aim.
What spoils it for Schopenhauer is the Judaic
element. This, on one side, infects it with the
optimism of the Biblical story of creation, in
which God 'saw everything that he had made,
and, behold, it was very good.' On the other
side, it contaminates the myth of original sin,
which bears in itself a profound philosophical
truth, by this same doctrine of a creative God;
from which follows all the injustice and irrationality
necessarily involved in the Augustinian
theology, and not to be expelled except with its
theism. Nevertheless, the story of the Fall of
Man, of which that theology, in its fundamentally
true part, is a reasoned expression, is the one
thing, Schopenhauer avows, that reconciles him
to the Old Testament. The truth that it clothes
he finds also among the Greeks; Empedocles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
after the Orphics and Pythagoreans, having
taught that the soul had been doomed to wander
because of some antenatal sin. And the mysticism
that accompanies all these more or less pure expressions
of one metaphysical truth he finds represented
by the Sufis even in optimistic Islam; so
that he can claim for his philosophy a world-wide
consent.</p>

<p>Religion, if we take this to include mysticism,
at once rises above philosophy and falls below it.
As 'metaphysics of the people,' it is a mythological
expression of philosophical truth: as
mysticism, it is a kind of 'epi-philosophy.'
Beyond pure philosophy Schopenhauer does not
profess to go; but he accepts what the mystics
say as the description of a positive experience
which becomes accessible when supreme insight
is attained intuitively. For the philosopher as
such, insight into that which is beyond the forms
of our knowledge and even beyond the will itself,
remains only conceptual; though it is within the
province of philosophy to mark out the place for
this. The 'something else' that is left when the
will has been denied, is indicated by the 'ecstasy,'
'illumination,' 'union with God,' spoken of by
the mystics. Paradoxically, some of the mystics
themselves even have identified it with 'nothing';<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
but the result of the denial of the will to live is to
be called nothing only in relation to the world as
we know it. 'On the other hand, to those in
whom the will has turned back and denied itself,
this so very real world of ours with all its suns
and milky ways is&mdash;nothing.'</p>

<p>In this terminus of his philosophy, Schopenhauer
recognised his kinship with Indian thought,
of which he was a lifelong student. To call his
doctrine a kind of Buddhism is, however, in some
ways a misapprehension. Undoubtedly he accepts
as his ideal the ethical attitude that he finds to
be common to Buddhism and the Christianity of
the New Testament; but metaphysical differences
mark him off from both. We have seen that he
rejects the extra-mundane God of Semitic derivation,
adopted by historical Christianity. Indeed
he is one of the most pronounced anti-Jehovists
of all literature. But equally his belief in a positive
metaphysical doctrine marks him off from
Buddhism, according to the account given of it by
its most recent students, who regard it either as
ultimately nihilistic or as having no metaphysics
at all, but only a psychology and ethics. Nor can
he be precisely identified with the Vedantists of
orthodox Hinduism. Their ultimate reality, if
we are to find an analogue for it in European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
metaphysics, seems to resemble the hypostasised
<i>ego</i> of Fichte, or the Kantian 'transcendental
unity of apperception', much more than it
resembles Schopenhauer's blindly striving will as
thing-in-itself. Even in practical ethics, he does
not follow the Indian systems at all closely.
Philosophical doctrines of justice are of course
purely European; and Schopenhauer himself
points out the sources of his own theory. In his
extension of ethics to animals, on which he lays
much stress, he cites the teachings of Eastern
non-Semitic religions as superior to the rest; but
he does not follow the Indians, nor even the
Pythagoreans, so far as to make abstinence from
flesh part of the ideal. He condemns vivisection
on the ground that animals have rights: certain
ways of treating them are unjust, not simply uncompassionate.
The discussion here again is of
course wholly within European thought. Thus,
in trying to determine his significance for modern
philosophy, we may consider his system in its
immediate environment, leaving it to more special
students to determine how far it received a
peculiar colouring from the Oriental philosophies,
of which, in his time, the more exact knowledge
was just beginning to penetrate to the West.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE</h3>


<p>Schopenhauer is not one of the philosophers
who have founded a school, though he has had
many disciples and enthusiastic admirers. The
pessimism that was for a time a watchword with
certain literary groups has passed as a mode, and
his true significance must be sought elsewhere.
Of the thinkers who have followed him in his
pessimism, two indeed stand out as the architects
of distinct systems, Eduard von Hartmann and
Philipp Mainländer (both already incidentally
referred to); but while they are to be classed unquestionably
as philosophers, their systems contain
an element that their master would have regarded
as mythological. Schopenhauer declared as
clearly as any of the Greeks that the phenomenal
world is without beginning and without end.
Kant's positing of an 'antinomy' on this point he
regarded as wholly without rational justification.
What Kant calls the 'antithesis,' namely, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
infinite series, can be logically proved for phenomena.
The 'thesis,' which asserts a beginning in
time, is defended by mere fallacies. Now Hartmann
and Mainländer both hold, though in
different fashions, that there is a world-process
from a beginning to an end, namely, the extinction
of consciousness. This is the redemption of
the world. Their affinity, therefore, seems to be
with the Christian Gnostics rather than with the
pure philosophers of the Greek tradition, continued
in modern times by Bruno, Spinoza, and
Schopenhauer.</p>

<p>Whatever may be thought of the pessimism
by which Schopenhauer's mood is distinguished
from that of his precursors, few will fail to recognise
that special doctrines of his system contain
at least a large portion of truth. His theories of
Art, of Genius, and of Love are enough to found
an enduring reputation for any thinker, even if
there were nothing else of value in his writings.
But there is much else, both in systematic construction
and in the illumination of detail. I
have been inclined to put forward first of all the
translation into idealistic terms of the universal
sentiency held by the Ionian thinkers to be inherent
in the primordial elements of nature.
While they viewed the world as an objective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
thing having psychological qualities, Schopenhauer,
after the long intermediate process of
thought, could treat it as phenomenal object with
a psychological or subjective essence. For both
doctrines alike, however, mind or soul is immanent.
Still, it must be allowed that a difference
remains by which Schopenhauer was even more
remote than they were from the later Greek
idealism. As they were not materialists, so they
did not exclude reason from the psychical properties
of their substances. Schopenhauer, while
he rejected the materialism of their ancient and
modern successors alike, took the step of formally
derationalising the elements of mind. This, no
doubt, is unsustainable ultimately, if reason is
ever to emerge from them. Yet the one-sidedness
of the position has had a peculiar value in
combating an equally one-sided rationalistic
idealism. This is recognised by clear-sighted
opponents. And Schopenhauer's calling the non-rational
or anti-rational element in the world
'will' helps to make plainer the real problem of
evil. There is truth in the Hegelian paradox that
'pessimism is an excellent basis for optimism.'
An optimist like Plotinus saw that, even if good
comes of evil, the case of the optimist must fail
unless evil can be shown to be a necessary con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>stituent
of the world. The Platonic and Neo-Platonic
'matter,' a principle of diremption or
individuation, like time and space for Schopenhauer,
was an attempt to solve this problem; but
something more positive seemed to be needed
as the source of the stronger manifestations of
evil. To the strength of these Plato drew attention
in a passage (<i>Republic</i>, x. 610<a name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>) where it is
acknowledged that injustice confers a character of
vitality and sleeplessness upon its possessor. In
the notion of a blind and vehement striving,
Schopenhauer supplies something adequate; only,
to maintain a rational optimism, it must be regarded
as a necessary element in a mixture, not
as the spring of the whole.</p>

<p>Much might be said on the teleology by which
he tries to educe intelligence from the primordial
strife. Against his view, that it is evolved as
a mere instrument for preserving races in a
struggle, another may be set that is ready to
hand in a dialogue of Plutarch.<a name="FNanchor_2_6" id="FNanchor_2_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The struggle
among animals, it is there incidentally argued,
has for its end to sharpen their intelligence.
Both these theories are on the surface compatible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
with evolution. If, leaving aside the problem of
mechanism, we try to verify them by the test of
results, the latter undoubtedly seems the more
plausible. For if the struggle was a means to
the improvement of intelligence, nature has succeeded
more and more; whereas, if her intention
was to preserve races, she has continually failed.
This argument is at any rate perfectly valid
against Schopenhauer himself; for he holds in
common with the optimistic teleologists that
'nature does nothing in vain.'</p>

<p>I will conclude with a few detached criticisms
on the ethical doctrine which he regarded as the
culmination of his system. The antithesis, it
may first be noted, between the temporary release
from the vehemence of the will that is gained
through art, and the permanent release through
asceticism, is not consistently maintained. Schopenhauer
admits that the knowledge which for
the ascetic is the 'quietive' of the will has to be
won anew in a perpetual conflict. 'No one can
have enduring rest on earth.' Again, revision of
his doctrine concerning the reality of the individual
would, I think, necessitate revision also of
the position that not only asceticism but 'all true
and pure love, nay, even freely rendered justice,
proceeds from seeing through the <i>principium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
individuationis</i>.' If the individual is in some
sense ultimately real, then love must be to a certain
extent literally altruism. We are brought
down to the elementary fact, in terms of the
metaphysics of ethics, that the object of love is a
real being that is itself and not ourselves, though
having some resemblance to us and united in
a larger whole. An objection not merely verbal
might indeed be taken to Schopenhauer's metaphysics
of ethics strictly on his own ground. If
it is purely and simply the essence of ourselves
that we recognise in everything, does not this reduce
all love finally to a well-understood egoism?
The genuine fact of sympathy seems to escape his
mode of formulation. And, in the end, we shall
perhaps not find the ascetic to be the supreme
ethical type. Of the self-tormenting kind of
asceticism, it is not enough to say with Schopenhauer
that, since it is a world-wide phenomenon
of human nature, it calls for some account from
philosophy. The account may be sufficiently
rendered by historical psychology; the result
being to class it as an aberration born of the illusions
incident to a certain type of mind at a certain
stage. Indeed, that seems to be the conclusion
of the Buddhists, who claim to have transcended
it by finding it superfluous for the end it aims at.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Let us then take, as our example of the completed
type, not the monks of the Thebaid, but the
mild ascetics of the Buddhist communities. Does
not this type, even in its most attractive form,
represent a 'second best'? Is not the final
judgment that of Plato, that to save oneself is
something, but that there is no full achievement
unless for the life of the State also the ideal has
been brought nearer realisation? When there is
nothing in the world but irredeemable tyranny or
anarchy, flight from it may be the greatest success
possible as far as the individual life is concerned;
but this is not the normal condition of humanity.
Finally, may not some actual achievement, either
practical or, like that of Schopenhauer, speculative,
even if accompanied by real imperfections of
character, possess a higher human value than the
sanctity that rests always in itself?</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
